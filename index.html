                        Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that
                        eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won
                        the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and immigrated to
                        the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis. Einstein is generally
                        considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work also having a major
                        impact on the development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory during his
                        later years, Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.
